# :gem: DiamondMaker

Your goal for this assignment is to write a Java program ( main method ) that creates a diamond shape, using the /, \, ^, V, <, and > symbols (ASCII Art). 

Your program should begin by asking the user to input the size of the diamond to be created, using the Scanner class.  The size the user inputs should not count the corners of the diamond.  You can see an example of the diamond below:  Note the top character is ^ ( shift + 6 ) and the bottom is the letter v. 

```
Size 2:
        ^ 
       / \ 
      /   \ 
     <     > 
      \   / 
       \ /
        V 
        
Size 1:

      ^
     / \
    <   >
     \ /
      v
        
Size 0: -- i know, Size 0 doesn't look the nicest.  
      ^
     < >
      v
```

## Optional Extra Challenge:
For an optional extra challenge, modify your program to also draw diagonals across the diamond, using the |, -, and + symbols.  
The user should have the option to create a diamond with or without the diagonals.  

```
        ^ 
       /|\ 
      / | \ 
     <--+--> 
      \ | / 
       \|/
        V 

```
